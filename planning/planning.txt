Project Idea:

The Application tracks the current location of the ISS and displays it via google maps, with accompanying data of the country it is over. In addition:
A user can save locations and get distance to ISS's current location
A user can update/delete saved locations
A user can find a location on the opposite side of the world


Models:

Location:

Title of Saved Location
Saved location Coordinates (Lat, Long)

things to do: 

```the link to go to the user page didn't get copied to the header. Your job is to link "Hello, Felix" to link to the user page```

```make every component responsive```
```make home page map full screen using flexbox```
```making the edit page```
```completing styling of the settings```
```complete CRUD for saved location using authentication```

```link the user page to the backend```
```link user edit and delete to backend```
```please style saved locations using actual maps please. No more satelites. We need to see how the maps will actually look with the grid```

```figure out the google maps API for locating the distance from a location to another location (this is the most important part for our app!!)```
