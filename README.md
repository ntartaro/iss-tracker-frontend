#  ISS-WOW
Where Over the World is the International Space Station? Welcome to a collaboration between me and Luis Ortiz for our General Asembly Web Development Immersive. Our site can be found at ()

## Website Features
The idea behind our site was to be able to visually track the ISS using Google Maps and allow users to see how far away the ISS is from a given location.

Users are able to:
- sign up and log in with full authentication and password hashing
- create and save location cards with titles and locations showing the visual distance to the ISS
- see the current location of the ISS and the name of the city it is over, if any

Future features we'd like to implement:
- distance between saved location and ISS in miles/kilometers (in progress)
- number of rotations and length of time untill ISS is above a specific location

## Technologies Used
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- React
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Axios
- Google Static Map API
- Open Notify ISS Current Location API (http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json)
